# Functionally-Reduced-And-Inverter-Graph
A program that implemented circuit-simplifying by using C++

Objectives:
1. Using hash to detect structurally equivalent signals in a circuit.
2. Performing Boolean logic simulations and designing your own data structure to identify functionally equivalent candidate pairs in the circuit.
3. Being able to call Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove the functional equivalence.
